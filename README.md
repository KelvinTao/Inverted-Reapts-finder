# Inverted-Reapts-finder_DNA
Searching all the inverted repeats in the DNA sequences starting with 6 consecutive matched characters.

# Main Function Details
IRfinderAll.m is an demo for how to use Inverted Repeats finder in the DNA sequence.  
IRFinderS.m is an ready-made function for use.  
findIRiniS.m is an main function for IR.  
IRCodlocDyMatc.m is an locally dynamic function for sequence alignment.

# Small Functions
outputSum.m and outputSumNoZero.m for summary of IR searching results.  
scale6.m and reverScale6.m for consecutive 6 DNA characters to numbers for initial searching.  
lettercmp for judging whether the two characters are one pair of A-T and C-G.  
convert.m for an DNA character to a number.  
lastClear.m for keeping only one searching result of the same ones.
